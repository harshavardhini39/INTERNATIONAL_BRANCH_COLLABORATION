# Cross-Region Replication Project Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up cross-region replication for an AWS S3 bucket from the US (Northern Virginia) branch to the Mumbai branch. It also covers the IAM policies to be assigned to Mumbai branch employees based on their roles.

## Project Overview

In this project, the US (Northern Virginia) branch assigns project work to the Mumbai branch using cross-region replication for AWS S3 buckets. Whenever the US branch uploads a project to the S3 bucket in Northern Virginia, it will be automatically replicated to the S3 bucket in Mumbai.

## S3 Cross-Region Replication

### Configuration

1. Create two S3 buckets: one in the US (Northern Virginia) region and another in the Mumbai region.

2. Configure cross-region replication for the US bucket to replicate objects to the Mumbai bucket. Use AWS IAM roles and policies to allow replication.

3. Set up appropriate permissions and bucket policies to ensure secure replication.

### Testing Replication

1. Upload a test file to the US bucket.

2. Verify that the file is automatically replicated to the Mumbai bucket.

## IAM Policies

IAM policies will be assigned to Mumbai branch employees based on their roles:

### Web Developer

#### Elastic Beanstalk Access Policy

The web developer will have access to Elastic Beanstalk for web development-related tasks.

1. Assign the `AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess` policy to the IAM user representing the web developer.

### Database Administrator

#### Access to AWS RDS and AWS DynamoDB

The database administrator will have access to AWS RDS and AWS DynamoDB for database-related tasks.

1. Create a custom IAM policy that allows access to the necessary AWS services (RDS and DynamoDB).

2. Assign this custom policy to the IAM user representing the database administrator.

### Elastic Computation User

#### AWS EC2 Full Access

The user responsible for elastic computation tasks will have full access to AWS EC2 instances.

1. Assign the `AmazonEC2FullAccess` policy to the IAM user representing the elastic computation user.

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview of setting up cross-region replication for S3 buckets and configuring IAM policies for Mumbai branch employees based on their roles. Follow these instructions to ensure secure project communication and access control.
